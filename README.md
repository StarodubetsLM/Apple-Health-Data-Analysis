# Apple-Health-Data-Analysis
Hi, and thank you for visiting my project!
## Project Objectives

:black_small_square: Analyze overall activity levels (steps, distance, calories burned, etc.)
:black_small_square: Identify daily, weekly, and monthly trends
:black_small_square: Compare weekday vs. weekend activity
:black_small_square: Detect recurring patterns in behavior
:black_small_square: Build an interactive dashboard for clear and actionable insights

## Tools & Technologies
:black_small_square: Power BI – Dashboard development & data modeling
:black_small_square: Power Query – XML data transformation and cleaning
:black_small_square: DAX – Calculated measures and KPIs
:black_small_square: XML (Apple Health export.xml) – Raw data source

## Data Preparation
The Apple Health data was exported in XML format, which required significant preprocessing:
:black_small_square: Imported and parsed structured XML data into Power BI
:black_small_square: Filtered relevant health metrics (e.g., steps, calories, distance)
:black_small_square: Removed unnecessary attributes and duplicate entries
:black_small_square: Standardized date and time formats
:black_small_square: Created calculated columns (Year, Month, Week, Day of Week)
:black_small_square: Developed DAX measures for totals, averages, and trend comparisons
:black_small_square: Working with XML strengthened my data transformation and data modeling skills.
